Module 1 Challenge

This is an updated/criteria met committed webpage from the UMN coding bootcamp assignment week 1 module challenge. 
The purpose was to increase readability and make aspects of the front and back end be more accessible. In summation,
it's a practice criteria acceptance in the scenario of revising an already existing webpage to be more accessible by
working through GitHub, GitBash, and VS Code.
